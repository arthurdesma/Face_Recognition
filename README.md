## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how Facebook can recognize your friends in photographs? As humans, we're naturally wired to recognize faces, but teaching a computer to do the same is a complex task. In this project, we'll explore the complete face recognition pipeline, from detecting a face in an image to predicting its identity.

## Required Packages

To complete this project, I used the following packages:

- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org)
- [Keras](https://keras.io)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org)
- [Dlib](http://dlib.net)

## project Overview

In this project, I have:

1. **Face Detection**: Identify and locate faces in an image.
2. **Pose Estimation**: Determine the orientation of a face and correct its pose.
3. **Face Encoding**: Extract unique features from a face to distinguish it from others.
4. **Face Recognition**: Compare the features of a face to those in a database and predict the identity.
5. **Personal Dataset**: Build my  own face recognition dataset.
